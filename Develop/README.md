  # Description
  My project was to create a mechanism that upon a simple command would generate a professional README file. A well thought out README file goes a long way to showing those who review or intend to utilize what you’ve created that you’ve mapped out installation and usage, credited those who contributed, identified license usage and that the tool has been tested.

  ## Installation
  To use the README generator, you must have node.js as well as the npm inquirer package uploaded. All activity will be from the terminal in VS Code. I personally like to use GitBash.


  ## Usage
  Creating a README file using this tool is quite easy. Simply navigate to the ‘Develop’ folder and type in ‘node index’ from the terminal and begin answering the prompts! At the end you will get a message that says, "Your README is generated!" and you can inspect your finished product.


  ## Contributors
  This is where you list anyone who helped you create the project. For this one, it was just me but I leaned heavily on the Week 9 asynchronous work and Google!
